Api use in the project from https://www.coingecko.com/

Project Title: Crypto Price Tracking Web Application
Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly web application that enables users to track cryptocurrency prices in real-time. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, the need for accurate and timely information has become paramount for investors and enthusiasts alike. By utilizing the CoinGecko API, this application will provide up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies, empowering users with the tools they need to make informed investment decisions. This document outlines the technology stack, key features, and an overall development plan for the application.

Technology Stack
The application will be built using a modern and efficient technology stack:

Frontend: React will be used for building the user interface, leveraging Vite as a build tool for fast development and optimized performance.
API: The CoinGecko API will serve as the primary data source for real-time cryptocurrency information, including prices, market capitalization, and historical data.
State Management: The React Context API will be utilized for managing global state, allowing for seamless data flow across components without prop drilling.
Styling: CSS Modules will be used for styling the components, enabling scoped styles and preventing class name conflicts.
Version Control: Git and GitHub will be employed for source code management, facilitating collaboration and version tracking.
Hosting: Vercel will be chosen for hosting the application, ensuring fast load times and easy deployment.
Analytics: Google Analytics may be integrated for tracking user interactions, providing insights into how users engage with the application.
Key Features
The application will include several key features to enhance user experience and functionality:

1. Real-Time Price Updates
The core feature of the application is the ability to display live cryptocurrency prices. Users will be able to see current prices for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many others. The application will utilize the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time data, ensuring that users have access to the latest price information.

2. Search Functionality
To improve user navigation, the application will include a search functionality. Users can easily search for specific cryptocurrencies by name or symbol, enabling quick access to the information they need. This feature will enhance usability, especially for those who are interested in less common coins.

3. Historical Price Data
To assist users in making informed investment decisions, the application will offer historical price data through interactive graphs and charts. Users will be able to select different time frames (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year) to view price trends and better understand market movements. This feature will provide valuable insights into the performance of different cryptocurrencies over time.

4. Favorites List
The application will allow users to save their favorite cryptocurrencies in a personalized favorites list. This feature will enable quick access to frequently monitored assets, improving the overall user experience. Users will be able to easily add or remove coins from their favorites, ensuring a customizable experience.

5. User-Friendly Interface
The design of the application will prioritize user experience, featuring a clean and intuitive layout. Users will find it easy to navigate through the application, access key information, and utilize all available features without confusion. Clear labeling and consistent design elements will contribute to a polished user interface.

6. Responsive Design
To cater to a wide audience, the application will be designed with responsiveness in mind. It will be fully functional across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This ensures that users can track cryptocurrency prices wherever they are, making it a convenient tool for on-the-go investors.

7. Error Handling
Robust error handling will be implemented to manage potential issues that may arise during API calls or user interactions. Users will receive clear error messages, and fallback mechanisms will ensure that the application remains functional even in the event of API outages or unexpected errors.

8. Documentation
Comprehensive documentation will be provided to assist users in setting up and utilizing the application effectively. This will include detailed setup instructions, explanations of features, and troubleshooting tips. User documentation will help to enhance the overall user experience and provide support for those who may be less technically inclined.
